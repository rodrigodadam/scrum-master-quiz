## Project Goals

Every day a lot of IT companies and also non IT companies are starting using the Agile Principles and one of the greatest Agile framework is SCRUM. 
We can see in some recruiters web-site, like Indeed or LinkkedIN a increase a demand for these professionals and every day more people are looking for SCRUM MASTER Certification. This Project Main Goal is help these people who are looking for the SCRUM MASTER Certification giving them a small test to check their knowledge about the Scrum Master and how this works. As I'm a Certifield Scrum Master, I created the questions based in the [SCRUM GUIDE](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide). 

The Second Goal of this project is help Web and Software Developers who are looking how build a simple quiz. This Web-Application was built in a way that anyone can only modify the questions and answers and thus have your quiz with a particular subject that suits your porpose.  


## Users Experience Plan


- ### Player Strategy Plan

The website is designed for the people who would like test the knowledge about SCRUM MASTER also could play with friends. It's a great tool for increase the user understanding about the certification test and what he can wait. The web-application was build to be ease to use, the Player just need go to [web-site](https://rodrigodadam.github.io/scrum-master-quiz/) and start to play. After finish the game or the time is out the player can Try Again, if do not pass or put you Name in the Best Scores History that will be storage on local storage.

Also the project is structured in a way that is easy to access and understand to make the necessary changes in the Design and in the Game Controllers.

- **Home Page** (`index.html`)

<br>

![Home Page](https://github.com/rodrigodadam/scrum-master-quiz/blob/main/assets/images/structure/design/homepage.png)

<br>

The main page of the website. There is a game name, and 2 buttons. One is [Take a Quiz](https://rodrigodadam.github.io/scrum-master-quiz/game.html) that will start the quiz immediatly and the another one is [See Best Scores](https://rodrigodadam.github.io/scrum-master-quiz/best-scores.html) which will take the player to the page with the best scores played in that browser. Also there is a [Footer](https://github.com/rodrigodadam/scrum-master-quiz/blob/main/assets/images/structure/design/footer.png) with the simple informations about me that will take the player to my personal webpage.

<br>

- **Game Page** (`game.html`)

<br>

![Game Page](https://github.com/rodrigodadam/scrum-master-quiz/blob/main/assets/images/structure/design/gamepage.png)

<br>

This panel is an User Friendly interface and is simple to use. 
At the top the Player can see the [Game Display](https://github.com/rodrigodadam/scrum-master-quiz/blob/main/assets/images/structure/design/gamedisplay.png) where easy the User can track their Score, the Time remaning and how many questions was answered/remaining.
At the midle the User can see the Properly Question follow below for 5 options to be answered and only one is correct.

When the player select an option that answer will change the color for a brief time to give time to player see if the options is correct or incorrect. To correct option the user will see the answer turn yo green to incorrect will turn to red. Also for each correct answer the player score will be increased.

To be User Friendly I've used the [Bootstrap Collor Pallete](https://colorswall.com/palette/3) to show the players whem they select Correct as answers and Incorrect Answers. More info about the colors in [Design Plan](#Design-Plan)

In all devices the game and the display are in the same positions to avoid visual position problems.

## PROJECT BARRIERS & SOLUTIONS




## Deployment

### Project Creation
To create this project I used the CI Gitpod Full Template by navigating 
[here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking the 'Use this template' button.

I was then directed to the create new repository from template page and entered in my desired repo name, then 
clicked Create repository from template button.

Once created, I navigated to my new repository on GitHub and clicked the Gitpod button which built my workspace.

The following commands were used for version control throughout the project:

* git add *filename* - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.

* git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.

* git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.


### Deployment to GitHub


### Fork Project 

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point 
for your own idea. - Definition from [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.
1. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

1. This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.
