## PROJECT BARRIERS & SOLUTIONS




## Deployment

### Project Creation
To create this project I used the CI Gitpod Full Template by navigating 
[here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking the 'Use this template' button.

I was then directed to the create new repository from template page and entered in my desired repo name, then 
clicked Create repository from template button.

Once created, I navigated to my new repository on GitHub and clicked the Gitpod button which built my workspace.

The following commands were used for version control throughout the project:

* git add *filename* - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.

* git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.

* git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.


### Deployment to GitHub


### Fork Project 

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point 
for your own idea. - Definition from [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.
1. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.
